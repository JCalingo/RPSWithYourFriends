# RPSWithYourFriends
Rock Paper Scissors with your "friends"! What could be more fun than that? Well...

# How it (is supposed to) work(s)

Two users will be put together. They will each choose rock, paper, or scissors, and then their choices will be compared. If they choose the same thing, then it's a draw. Otherwise, one will win and the other will lose based on regular Rock Paper Scissors rules.<br/>

However...I haven't quite figured out the whole "connecting two people together" bit yet, so for now it's just a game against the computer which picks one of the three at random.
